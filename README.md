# Health-Monitor-System
An IoT-based health monitoring system that integrates body temperature and heart rate sensors with the Tiva C Series microcontroller. The project uses FreeRTOS for task scheduling, ESP8266 for cloud communication, and Firebase for real-time data logging, with a user interface and alert system for remote health tracking.
